# Operating Systems

This repo collects my work for a [university course](https://sylabusy.agh.edu.pl/en/document/b460194c-e1bf-4c16-8ad2-e1b6e445952e.pdf) called as above focusing on Linux programming in C.

There is also [a little bash script](cleanzip.sh) that automates fulfilling work submission requirements :)
